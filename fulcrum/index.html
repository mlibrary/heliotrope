          <h5>Northwestern University Press, 2016</h5>
          <p class="light"><em>The Director's Prism</em> investigates how and why three of Russia's most innovative directors— Vsevolod Meyerhold, Alexander Tairov, and Sergei Eisenstein—used the fantastical tales of German Romantic writer E. T. A. Hoffmann to reinvent the rules of theatrical practice. Fulcrum allowed Northwestern University Press to publish video clips of theatrical productions, an audio file, and additional full color images that can be viewed in more detail with Fulcrum's image viewer.</p>

          <h5>University of Minnesota Press, 2016</h5>
          <p class="light"><em>Canoes: A Natural History</em> explores the cultural history of one of North America's totemic artifacts, featuring canoes old and new, from birch bark to dugout to carbon fiber; the people who made them; and the adventures they shared.

          <h5>University of Michigan Press, 2014</h5>
          <p class="light"><em>Animal Acts</em> is a unique collection that explores the fields of animal studies and performance studies, highlighting the areas where these two fields overlap in surprising, provocative, and insightful ways. Eleven stories by solo performers are accompanied by commentary from scholars and artists. Fulcrum allowed the University of Michigan Press to publish video excerpts of several of the performances discussed in the book. </p>

          <h5>Penn State University Press, 2016</h5>
          <p class="light">Volume 2 of <em>Nothing but Love in God’s Water</em> by Robert Darden, continues the journey started in Volume 1 of chronicling the role music played in energizing and sustaining those most heavily involved in the civil rights movement. On Fulcrum, Penn State University Press was able to present an impressive array of images and interview transcripts collected by the author to support his scholarship. While the interview transcripts are not hosted on Fulcrum, the platform provides a durable landing page for each transcript, which then links to the externally hosted file. This gives the reader the ability to explore all of the materials in a much more cohesive manner.</p>
