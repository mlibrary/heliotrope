<p>Durability is among Fulcrum's core values, and the foundation of our durability
lies in our commitment to the preservation of the content which we publish. Our
goal is to make publishing content on Fulcrum synonymous with adding it to the
durable record of scholarship, as there is no preservation without access, and
there is no access without preservation. This Preservation Statement expresses
that commitment by answering the questions: "What can I expect a future scholar
to encounter if they follow my citation to content I used on Fulcrum? How
faithful should I expect a future representation of this content to be to what I
see on Fulcrum today?"</p>

<p>In the interest of transparency and trustworthiness, this statement will
summarize the decisions we have made and anticipate the decisions we will have
to make in the future. We plan to revisit our preservation policies, and update
this document accordingly, on an annual basis.</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Digital preservation is often discussed in terms of technologies and file
formats, but the Fulcrum team considers preservation primarily a commitment of
time, attention, and active management of data and metadata. Through these
commitments we will develop and maintain a variety of technological strategies
and partnerships to achieve our commitments to durable publishing. As the future
is unknown, successfully fulfilling our commitments requires a diversity of
approaches to mitigate risk.</p>

<h3>Strategic Diversity</h3>
<p>The digital preservation community has identified a number of <a href="https://www.lib.umich.edu/preservation-and-conservation/digital-preservation/what-digital-preservation">basic
strategies</a> for digital preservation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bit preservation: Preserving the data exactly as it is, with the guarantee
that no data loss or corruption has occurred. This strategy is a prerequisite
for all other digital preservation strategies; alone, however, it offers no
promise of future usability or viability of the data due to file format
obsolescence.
<li>Migration: Overcoming file formatting obsolescence by reformatting the
content as necessary to usable successor formats. Choosing file formats that
conform to open standards greatly increases the ability to do this without loss
of content features; however, the migration process may result in changes to the
presentation of the content.
<li>Emulation: Imitating the original (obsolete or unavailable) hardware or
software on which the content was served in order to render the original digital
object "as is", preserving the original presentation and user experience as much
as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fulcrum is employing a number of methods to achieve bit and migration
preservation strategies, as detailed below. U-M Library is a sustaining member
of the Software Preservation Network and is following with interest research in
the area of sustainable emulation strategies, but we are not yet employing an
emulation strategy at this time.</p>

<h3>Institutional and Geographic Diversity</h3>
<p>Fulcrum fulfills its preservation commitments through a strategy based on
balancing local and distributed resources. By engaging in a number of such
relationships, Fulcrum guards against the risk of technological failure, changes
in institutional priorities, or inability to meet commitments at any one
institution, thereby eliminating single points of failure and ensuring the
long-term access to content published on Fulcrum.</p>

<h4>The University of Michigan Library</h4>
<p>The strength of Fulcrum's preservation commitment derives from its home within a
Tier 1 research library which embodies preservation as core to its mission. As a
result, Fulcrum adheres to the policies and practices of U-M Library, and
content hosted on Fulcrum is preserved according to the same policies and
practices, and with the same dedicated, committed effort, as all of U-M
Library's digital collections.</p>

<p>U-M Library's institutional stance is strongly predisposed to migration
strategies, which we enable via policies that restrict file formats at the point
of ingest. Our <a href="https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/static/about/deepbluepreservation.html">file
format guidelines</a> are based on the recommendations of the Library of
Congress and reflect the accepted best practices of the digital preservation
community. (Fulcrum's file format recommendations may place further restrictions
based on compatibility with software tools, functionality on our platform,
publishing industry standards and accessibility.) The open, published standards
represented in these guidelines put us in the best position today to
successfully migrate content to tomorrow's successor formats.</p>

<p>On those occasions where no open standard is available, or the <em>de facto</em>
standard within a given discipline is a proprietary file format, Fulcrum may
host the file with a commitment only to bit preservation. In those cases, when
the file becomes obsolete, we may continue to host it as-is as an artifact of
possible historical interest.</p>

<p>Fulcrum follows the principle of "Preservation is Access, Access is
Preservation". Our Hyrax platform is backed by a Fedora 4 repository where
preservation masters are managed in the U-M datacenter; masters are stored on
and backed up using enterprise-quality equipment and services provided by U-M
Information Technology Services. This same repository is used for managing both
the preservation masters and the access derivatives which are served to the
browser in a user session, their relationship expressed explicitly via RDF
metadata in our data model. In this way the same resources that maintain the
access repository also benefit the preservation repository, and any problems
that arise are more visible to the system administrators. Furthermore, by
keeping content in our preservation repository, we are also committing to
maintaining its access by readers.</p>

<h4>Preservation Partners</h4>
<p>Fulcrum has diversified its preservation portfolio through relationships with a
number of other organizations, each with their own technological implementation
and management structures. We have contracted with CLOCKSS and have begun a
pilot with HathiTrust to preserve content in their repository networks. Both are
CRL-certified TRAC-compliant and introduce geographically distributed redundancy
to our preservation solutions. Deposits into CLOCKSS and HathiTrust must be
configured on a per-collection basis; at the present time, our workflows cover
the University of Michigan Press Ebook Collection. If you're interested in
having your collection included in such an arrangement, please speak with the
Fulcrum team.</p>

<p>U-M Library is also a member of APTrust and is currently developing a workflow
to deposit all Fulcrum content into their cloud-based, consortially-governed
service, providing further organizational and geographic redundancy for
everything published on Fulcrum.</p>

<p>The culmination of local and partnered preservation commitments, which place our
content into storage networks distributed across multiple continents, actively
managed by a range of mission-driven, non-profit consortia and partnerships
(some of which have <a href="https://clockss.org/2018/11/clockss-formalizes-long-standing-commitments-from-four-leading-universities-to-ensure-perpetual-preservation/">their
own succession plans</a>), mitigate the risk of catastrophic failure on any
number of fronts, and help ensure that the content published on Fulcrum today
will remain in the scholarly record for many years to come.</p>

<h2>Scope of our preservation commitment</h2>
<p>Preservation always entails making choices about what to preserve. While Fulcrum
strives to capture the most comprehensive record possible of a published work,
finite resources of time, attention, and technology require the scrupulous
application of those resources in order to achieve a preservation strategy that
is most likely to succeed technologically while being comprehensible and useful
to future generations.</p>

<h3>What are we preserving?</h3>
<p>Fulcrum's preservation commitment is focused on maintaining a "Version of
Record" of the published work. Such a concept is intentionally malleable and
subject to change as technologies and publishing conventions evolve, but is
intended to capture the material that is essential to conveying the scholarly
argument embodied in a work. At present, we are focused on preserving the text
in EPUB3 format; any components embedded in the text (that would typically be
included in an EPUB3 file), such a figures, tables, or time-based media;
metadata, for the work as a whole, for the individual components, and
relationships among the parts; and any supplemental materials that may be hosted
on the platform. University of Michigan Library's  strategy focuses on
preserving all content in the form of its constituent files, migrating to new
formats when both necessary and possible. All content is accompanied by metadata
in schema that conform to current best practices in the Library community.
Deposits into APTrust will include the full range of content that U-M Library
commits to preserving. At present, CLOCKSS and HathiTrust are supporting ingest
and preservation support for the EPUB3 files, and we will be working to add
support for media formats in the future.</p>

<p>U-M Library will conduct a review after a 10 year period to determine if objects
hosted on Fulcrum should be retained and be subject to further, periodic,
reviews thereafter. The goal of these reviews is to identify and possibly remove
objects that have reached the end of their use and reuse life cycle, or have
become unusable due to format obsolescence. U-M Library may conduct the review
before 10 years if it identifies that a format is becoming obsolete. The
retention review will be conducted by U-M Library and, whenever possible, by the
partner who is responsible for its deposit.</p>

<p>In the eventuality that material is removed from Fulcrum due to retention review
or for legal or contractual reasons, we will maintain tombstones with the
metadata and a removal notice to which durable identifiers (DOIs, Handle System
URLs) will continue to resolve. Where possible and applicable, the tombstone
record will point to and/or resolve to the new location for the content.</p>

<h3>What are we not preserving?</h3>
<p>Fulcrum's preservation commitments do not at present attempt to capture the
context or user experience in which the materials described above are made
available to the public. The following are considered out of scope:</p>

<ul>
<li>Aboutware / Brochureware, including marketing and promotional materials.
<li>User experience: emulation, "look and feel", design changes over time, or
navigation methods.
<li>The Fulcrum software is hosted open source on GitHub, in accordance with
current U-M Library policy, but we do not currently have a strategy for
independently preserving the codebase beyond our current production and
development environments.
<li>Websites associated with materials published on Fulcrum but not hosted on
the platform.</li>
</ul>
